Hi there, I'm [Joel Azwar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-azwar-991b9817b/), a 3rd year CS student in Seneca College. 

If you want to use this space to write your biography here, edit the `index.md` file. You can put a picture in, too. Rename your picture to `profile.png` and put it in the `assets/images/` folder.

The social-icons footer can be used to link profiles from GitHub, OrcID and ReasearchGate aprart form the usual Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook. You can add your user ID in the `_config.yml` file to link your accounts.
