Today is Tuesday, 21st of December, 2021. I'd just finished my Fall semester the week before and felt pretty optimistic about the future, but also a little lost. 

### Fall 2021

I just had a pretty eventful semester (probably my toughest one yet, academically) did a lot of things, made a lot of mistakes, and learned a lot more. Long story short, I slacked off midway and left a backlog of tests and assignments on finals week. But perseverance helped me get through it, finish up my work, and I ended up learning quite a lot. Kind of funny how that turned out.

Either way, it's exciting, this year I felt significant growth as a programmer. Learning both practically from my Internship earlier this year, and theoretically in school. Concepts are starting to click and programming in general is becoming a lot less overwhelming and clear to me. I don't know what it is, the dopamine, serotonin, whatever brain chemicals reward you for learning something new, but it feels amazing, and I'm eager to keep this momentum going.

On the other hand, I've been working all year on my other hobby which is producing music. School had me put it on the backburner for a while but I'd planned to finish a project I'd been working on before the end of the year during the holiday break.

### Mindfulness

Yesterday was a day of mindfulness. I sat down and tried to analyze my thoughts. Sometimes my mind races too fast that it gets overwhelmed by a lot of thought and possibilities. I applied to that to my critical thinking, problem solving skills that run when coding. Then analyzed my thought/work process when making music and found that it's quite parallel (Especially since I've been leaning heavily towards programming electronic music lately)

### What's next?

I've been at a crossroads lately. Figuring out what I want to do with my life that will satisfy me professionally, and for so long I always thought it was either programming or music, and that whichever took off first is the boat I jump on. At the same time, I thought to really improve my skill on either crafts, required time and effort on only one, mutually exclusive. Yesterday I realized it doesn't have to be one or the other. There's a reason that they both intrigue me. It's because I have an understanding and appreciation of what code and music is, and their crafts, and how I perceive and understand both are very similar.

### Looking forward

And so 2022 is coming along. I've written my thoughts down and my goals are clear. Write code, write music, read code, listen to music. (and maybe a little exercise thrown in there too) And what better way to start off this new voyage with a blog to journal my coding learning experiences and little updates of the music on the way
